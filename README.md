# pwnage.py

Checks passwords against [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Python installed in order to run `pwnage.py`. Start by downloading the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
> *Note: pwnage.py has not been tested with Python 2 and will probably not work without changing some things.*

After Python is installed, you'll need to install the *Requests* library.
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Installing

Download the latest version from GitHub using Git.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zloether/pwnage.py.git
```
This will create a directory called *pwnage.py* and all the code will be in it.

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
